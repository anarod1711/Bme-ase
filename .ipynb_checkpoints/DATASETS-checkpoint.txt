Our dataset consists of instacart data from 2017. It was taken from the following URL.
URL: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017

It contains the following 5 tables: orders, products, aisles, departments, and order_products_SET, where SET is a 'prior' evaluation set or 'train' set.

Relationships between tables can be formed via the products and departments/aisles tables as each product belongs to a certain department or aisle. These products then form a relationship with whatever customer decided to add it to their order. The evaluation set tables also contain the frequency at which each customer buys a certain product

Insights into each table are given below and found at the following link:
