Our dataset is called uber_staging. It was taken from the following URL.
URL: https://movement.uber.com/cities?lang=en-US

The data represents Uber trips taken at various cities where Uber Movement is 
available. The data can be further filtered by days of the week, months, and the time of day. Other important and interesting
attributes include the travel time, origin zone, and destination zone. Getting insights into specific zones of a city allow
one to analyze where there is a higher or lower demand for Ubers with further analysis revealing why. 

These are the files that we used to make the dataset:
	travel_times_LA_2018_quarter1.csv	
 	travel_times_LA_2018_quarter3.csv		
 	travel_times_LA_2019_quarter1.csv		
 	travel_times_LA_2019_quarter3.csv
The dataset is composed of these tables:
	Quarter1_2018
	Quarter1_2019
	Quarter3_2018
	Quarter3_2019
These are their attributes:
sourceid	INTEGER	NULLABLE	
dstid	INTEGER	NULLABLE	
month	INTEGER	NULLABLE	
mean_travel_time	FLOAT	NULLABLE	
standard_deviation_travel_time	FLOAT	NULLABLE	
geometric_mean_travel_time	FLOAT	NULLABLE	
geometric_standard_deviation_travel_time	FLOAT	NULLABLE	

Relationships between tables can be formed via the source and final destination zones. Various final destinations can become source destinations and vice versa.
