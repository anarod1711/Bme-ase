---------------PRIMARY DATASET DESCRIPTION---------------
Our dataset consists of instacart data from 2017. It was taken from the following URL.
URL: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017

It contains the following 5 tables: orders, products, aisles, departments, and order_products_SET, where SET is a 'prior' evaluation set or 'train' set.

Relationships between tables can be formed via the products and departments/aisles tables as each product belongs to a certain department or aisle. These products then form a relationship with whatever customer decided to add it to their order. The evaluation set tables also contain the frequency at which each customer buys a certain product

Insights into each table are given below and found at the following link:

"__Orders (3.4m rows, 206k users):

order_id: order identifier
user_id: customer identifier
eval_set: which evaluation set this order belongs in (see SET described below)
order_number: the order sequence number for this user (1 = first, n = nth)
order_dow: the day of the week the order was placed on
order_hour_of_day: the hour of the day the order was placed on
days_since_prior: days since the last order, capped at 30 (with NAs for order_number = 1)


__Products (50k rows):

product_id: product identifier
product_name: name of the product
aisle_id: foreign key
department_id: foreign key


__Aisles (134 rows):

aisle_id: aisle identifier
aisle: the name of the aisle


__Deptartments (21 rows):

department_id: department identifier
department: the name of the department


__Order_products__SET (30m+ rows):

order_id: foreign key
product_id: foreign key
add_to_cart_order: order in which each product was added to cart
reordered: 1 if this product has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise
where SET is one of the four following evaluation sets (eval_set in orders):

"prior": orders prior to that users most recent order (~3.2m orders)
"train": training data supplied to participants (~131k orders)"




---------------SECONDARY DATASET DESCRIPTION---------------
Our dataset consists of Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database 2 (QFAHPD2) data by The United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA ERS)

URL: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/quarterly-food-at-home-price-database/quarterly-food-at-home-price-database/#Quarterly%20Food-at-Home%20Price%20Database-1%20(QFAHPD-1)

This dataset contains information about quarterly market-level prices for different food groups between the years 2004-2010. These food groups include Universal Product Code (UPC) foods, such as packaged and canned food, and random-weight (non-UPC) foods. The prices are traced back to different metropolitan markets and nonmetropolitan areas from household-level purchases. The household-level purchases' food prices were aggregated and used to estimate the market-level prices.

We want to analyze this data to be able to predict food prices for the year 2017 based on the data from 2004-2010. Then, we will map the food products in this dataset to the products in our primary dataset. After this, we should have Instacart data with prices for each product bought in each order. We can further analyze this data by looking at trends in user spending, such as how much was spent in one of the user's order vs another, or order price total per day of week, etc.
